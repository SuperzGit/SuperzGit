<br>
Iâ€™m 17 years old and aspiring to major in Computer Science, with a strong and growing interest in artificial intelligence and its potential to address real-world challenges. Beyond technology, Iâ€™m an avid gamer and enjoy staying active through sports such as volleyball and soccer. I also have a deep appreciation for reading and exploring philosophical ideas, which help broaden my perspective and critical thinking.
